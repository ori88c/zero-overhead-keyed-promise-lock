/**
 * ZeroOverheadKeyedLock
 * 
 * The `ZeroOverheadKeyedLock` class provides a lightweight Promise-based locking mechanism 
 * for Node.js projects, ensuring the mutually exclusive execution of tasks **associated with 
 * the same key**.
 * 
 * Each task is identified by a non-empty string key. If a task is submitted while another 
 * task with the same key is still executing, it will be queued and executed only after all 
 * previously pending tasks for that key have completed (whether resolved or rejected). 
 * Effectively, each key maintains a FIFO queue, ensuring that tasks execute sequentially.
 * 
 * ### Race Conditions: How Are They Possible in Single-Threaded JavaScript?
 * In Node.js, synchronous code blocks - those that do *not* contain an `await` keyword - are
 * guaranteed to execute within a single event-loop iteration. These blocks inherently do not
 * require synchronization, as their execution is mutually exclusive by definition and cannot
 * overlap.
 * In contrast, asynchronous tasks that include at least one `await`, necessarily span across
 * multiple event-loop iterations. Such tasks may require synchronization, when overlapping
 * executions could result in an inconsistent or invalid state.
 * In this regard, JavaScript's single-threaded nature differs inherently from that of
 * single-threaded C code, for example.
 * 
 * ### Under the Hood
 * Implementation-wise, the keyed lock maintains a map from each key to its corresponding 
 * (non-keyed) lock. In other words, this component **leverages a well-tested**, simpler 
 * building block while focusing on key management.
 * Locks associated with unused keys are automatically removed in an event-driven manner,
 * as a post-processing step after each critical section execution.
 * 
 * ### Modern API Design
 * Traditional lock APIs require explicit acquire and release steps, adding overhead and
 * responsibility on the user.
 * In contrast, `ZeroOverheadKeyedLock` manages task execution, abstracting away these details
 * and reducing user responsibility. The acquire and release steps are handled implicitly by the
 * execution method, reminiscent of the RAII idiom in C++.
 * 
 * ### Graceful Teardown
 * Task execution promises are tracked by the lock instance, ensuring no dangling promises.
 * This enables graceful teardown via the `waitForAllExistingTasksToComplete` method, in
 * scenarios where it is essential to ensure that all tasks - whether already executing or
 * queued - are fully processed before proceeding.
 * Examples include application shutdowns (e.g., `onModuleDestroy` in Nest.js applications)
 * or maintaining a clear state between integration tests.

   * 
   * @param key A non-empty string representing the key associated with a task.

   * Executes a given task exclusively, ensuring that only one task associated with the same key
   * can run at a time. It resolves or rejects when the task finishes execution, returning the
   * task's value or propagating any error it may throw.
   * 
   * If a task is submitted while another task with the same key is still executing, it will
   * be queued and executed only after all previously pending tasks for that key have completed
   * (whether resolved or rejected). 
   * Effectively, each key maintains a FIFO queue, ensuring that tasks execute sequentially.
   * 
   * ### Real-World Example: Batch Processing of Kafka Messages
   * Suppose you are consuming a batch of Kafka messages from the same partition concurrently, but
   * need to ensure sequential processing for messages associated with the same key. For example,
   * each message may represent an action on a user account, where processing multiple actions
   * concurrently could lead to race conditions.
   * Kafka experts might suggest increasing the number of partitions to ensure sequential processing
   * per partition. However, in practice, this approach can be costly. As a result, it is not uncommon
   * to prefer batch-processing messages from the same partition rather than increasing the partition
   * count.
   * A keyed lock ensures sequential processing of same-key messages during batch processing, e.g.,
   * by using the UserID as the key to avoid concurrent operations on the same user account.
   * 
   * @param key A non-empty string key associated with the task. For example, the UserID is a
   *            suitable key to ensure sequential operations on a user account.
   * @param criticalTask The asynchronous task to execute exclusively, ensuring it does not 
   *                     overlap with any other execution associated with the same key.
   * @throws Error thrown by the task itself.
   * @returns A promise that resolves with the task's return value or rejects with its error.

  /**
   * Exposes the currently executing task's promise for a specific key, if one is active.
   * Note that the returned promise may throw if the active task encounters an error.
   *
   * ### Smart Reuse
   * This property is useful in scenarios where launching a duplicate task is wasteful.
   * Instead of scheduling a new task, consumers can **await the ongoing execution** to
   * avoid redundant operations.
   *
   * ### Usage Example
   * For example, assume a Kafka message handler receives an event to provision an account
   * for a newly onboarded user. Since this operation should not be duplicated, you may
   * choose to wait for the current task to complete, if one is already in progress:
   * ```
   * const ongoing = onboardingLock.getCurrentExecution(userID);
   * if (ongoing) {
   *   await ongoing;
   * } else {
   *   await onboardingLock.executeExclusive(userID, onboardUserTask);
   * }
   * ```
   * #### Important Consideration
   * Please note that regardless of the scope of this example, an onboarding operation
   * should be implemented in an idempotent manner, even with this optimization.
   * In other words, developers should always account for the possibility of redundant executions.
   *
   * @param key A non-empty string key associated with the task.
   * @returns The currently executing taskâ€™s promise for the specified key, or `undefined`
   *          if no task is currently executing for that key.

  /**

   * This method is particularly useful in scenarios where it is essential to ensure that

   * Examples include application shutdowns (e.g., `onModuleDestroy` in Nest.js applications)

   * This need is especially relevant in Kubernetes ReplicaSet deployments. When an HPA controller
   * scales down, pods begin shutting down gracefully.
   *
   * ### Graceful Teardown
   * The returned promise only accounts for tasks registered at the time this method is called.
   * If this method is being used as part of a graceful shutdown process, the **caller must ensure**
   * that no additional tasks are registered after this method is called.
   * If there is any uncertainty about new tasks being registered, consider using the following pattern: 
   * ```ts
   * while (lock.activeKeysCount > 0) {
   *   await lock.waitForAllExistingTasksToComplete()
   * }
